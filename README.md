# Discord-bot-role-automatic-giver
A simple discord bot that just gives a role to a new arriving member of a guild.
Needs a ```config.json``` file with a token inside it:
```
{
  "token": "your token here"
}
```
After that just run ```npm install``` and after the install ```nodemon``` and that's it.
